TL;DR: If Ray Hettinger wrote a Neural Net, what would it look like?

Neural Nets are one of the simplest machine learning algorithms out there.
At it's core, it's just a series of matrix multiplcations with non linearities
on the forward pass, while the backward passes are just chain rules and more matrix multiplications
